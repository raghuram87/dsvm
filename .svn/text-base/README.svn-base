[Make Dependencies]
Build jnisvmlight:
	Download JNI-SVM-Light from http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mtb/svmlight/JNI_SVM-light-6.01-64bit.zip
	Unzip JNI_SVM-light-6.01-64bit.zip
	cd JNI_SVM-light-6.01-64bit/src/svmlight-6.0.1
	edit Makefile-linux for JAVAHOME
	make linux
	cd ../.. (to top-level directory)
	ant -f src/jnisvmlight/build.xml
	copy the contents of lib/ directory to peersim-pegasos/lib

Build jnipegasos:
	Download jnipegasos from https://power.ldeo.columbia.edu/svn/Proj/DSVM/jni-pegasos
	follow the README and build jnipegasos libraries
	copy the contents of lib/ directory to peersim-pegasos/lib
	
[Compile and Execution]
To compile: 
	make
	Or
	ant -f build.xml
	
To execute the config file xxx.cfg located in directory config:
	make xxx.cfg (check the config file for valid resourcepath )

To re-generate the documentation
	make doc
	Or
	ant -f build.xml doc
	
[Class Summary]

PegasosNode		A node class extended, so that it can have its own resources, like
				training data, and after training model file containing the local 
				weight vectors all in svmlight format.

GadgetProtocol	A CDprotocol implementation, which implements the Gadget protocol. Its
				nextCycle method is called in each cycle on each node

DummyObserver	An implementation of Control interface needed to control the simulation.
				it does nothing, so currently the simulation runs as the number of
				cycle is defined in config file
				
FinalControl	An implementation of Control interface written to do post-simulation work.
				It writes the global weight vector to files. 
				
[Configuration Variables]

simulation.cycles 10	## number of cycle in cycle driven simulation

network.size 20			## number of nodes in network
network.node peersim.gossip.PegasosNode	## Special Node class written for Pegasos 
network.node.resourcepath /opt/workspace/peersim-gossip/data	## path where training data files are there.

degree 5		## outdegree of nodes, used by overlay network protocol, which is in this case SimpleNewsCast 

protocol.0 newscast.SimpleNewscast	## overlay network protocol, should write new protocol based on B matrix or 
 					to simulate different kind of network
protocol.0.cache degree

protocol.1 peersim.gossip.GadgetProtocol	## Special protocol written for pegasos, implements gossip
protocol.1.linkable 0	## protocol identifier for overlay network
protocol.1.lambda 1		## learning rate for SVM
protocol.1.iter 3		## number of iteration in gadget protocol, equivalent to T

init.0 WireKOut		## initialization for linkable protocol
init.0.protocol 0
init.0.k degree

control.d0 peersim.gossip.DummyObserver	## control Class to control the execution of simulation, currently does 
					nothing, so simulation end when number of cycles end
control.d0.protocol 1		## to which protocol this control applies

control.f0 peersim.gossip.FinalControl	## a FINAL control class written to do some final cleanup work after the
					simulation ends
control.f0.protocol 1
control.f0.until 0		
control.f0.step 1
control.f0.FINAL	## FINAL keyword ensures this control runs only after simulation ends
