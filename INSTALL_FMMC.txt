Following steps are required to integrate the Gadget java code with fmmc matlab code.

1. Matlab's java server has to be running in order to accept requests from Gadget's jvm. I use a software called jamal to accomplish this. Download the jamal-2.2.jar here - http://matlab4java.wordpress.com/download and run com.jamal.server.MatlabServer (from Matlab)
2. Place the fmmc code in the same directory where jamal server is running. 
3. Add the jamal-2.2.jar into the classpath of Gadget.
4. Replace the GadgerProtocol.java file with the one attached and recompile, run.

(also additionally, might have to install cvx for matlab and also change the directory parameter for one of the MatlabClient calls in GadgetSVM of jamal API)
